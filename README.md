# HW-Wireframe
This is HTML wireframe exercise- Just building a frame

In this exercise, I created simple HTML and style pages. 
In the HTML page, I included basic HTML structure that includes Header, nav, section, aside, article, headings, paragraph and footer tags. 
In the css page, I included styling properties like background, color, height, width, float, margin, padding, clear, font-size, font-family, text-align and display.
